# 👋 Hi there!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  
I’m **Vincent "V7614"**, a Python hobbyist who makes fun and useful tools — mostly for learning and sharing.

## 🛠️ My Projects

### 🔢 [V7614 PyCalc](https://github.com/V7614/V7614-PyCalc)
A text-based calculator built in Python.  
Currently in early development (Alpha), so it's console-only for now — but a GUI version is coming in future versions like **Legacy** and **Standard**!

📦 Versions follow Semantic Versioning (`Classic`, `Alpha`, `Beta`, etc.)

> 🧠 *Learn more about PyCalc and its roadmap [here](https://github.com/V7614/V7614-PyCalc)!*
